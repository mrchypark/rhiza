# Queqlite HTTP SQL benchmark

`queqlite-bench` is a standalone Rust package for reproducible load tests of the Queqlite HTTP SQL API. It deliberately lives outside the main workspace and only uses the already-present `reqwest`, `serde`, and `serde_json` dependencies.

## Run

Provide at least one endpoint and a client token. The benchmark creates its table unless `--skip-setup` is set.

```sh
cargo run --release --manifest-path bench/Cargo.toml -- \
  --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:7101 \
  --token "$QUEQLITE_CLIENT_TOKEN" \
  --duration 60s \
  --warmup 10s \
  --concurrency 16 \
  --workload mixed \
  --write-percent 50 > benchmark.json
```

`QUEQLITE_BENCH_ENDPOINT` (a comma-separated endpoint list) or `QUEQLITE_ENDPOINT`, plus `QUEQLITE_CLIENT_TOKEN` or `QUEQLITE_BENCH_TOKEN`, can replace the endpoint and token flags. `--endpoint` may be repeated to define deterministic preferred-first failover order; every request starts at the first endpoint and tries later endpoints only for retryable failures.

Use either concurrency-driven load (omit `--target-rate`) or an aggregate open-loop start rate:

```sh
cargo run --release --manifest-path bench/Cargo.toml -- \
  --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:7101 --token "$QUEQLITE_CLIENT_TOKEN" \
  --duration 30s --warmup 5s --concurrency 8 --target-rate 200 \
  --workload write
```

Durations accept `ms`, `s`, `m`, and `h` suffixes; a bare value means seconds. The default duration is `30s`, warmup is `5s`, concurrency is `1`, request timeout is `10s`, and fault-command timeout is `5m` (`--fault-timeout`).

## Workloads

- `read`: sends `SELECT request_id, value FROM <table> WHERE request_id = ?` to `/v1/sql/query`.
- `write`: sends a unique command request id and `INSERT INTO <table> ... RETURNING request_id, value` to `/v1/sql/execute`. A write counts as a committed transaction only when the execute response has an applied index and returns its own request id.
- `mixed`: deterministically selects writes according to `--write-percent` (default `50`).

The default table is `queqlite_bench`; use `--table` for an isolated name. It must be a simple ASCII SQL identifier. Setup creates `request_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT NOT NULL` through the same HTTP API.

## Fault Hooks

Run a shell command at an offset from the beginning of the measured window:

```sh
cargo run --release --manifest-path bench/Cargo.toml -- \
  --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:7101 --token "$QUEQLITE_CLIENT_TOKEN" \
  --duration 60s --concurrency 12 --workload mixed \
  --fault 20s leader-restart "kubectl rollout restart statefulset/queqlite"
```

The JSON report records the supplied fault tag, configured `offset_seconds`, actual `command_start_offset_seconds`, completion flag, exit status, and `succeeded`, `failed`, or `unfinished` status. Requests are also aggregated into `before`, `during`, and `after` windows: `during` starts when the command is invoked and ends when it returns. Traffic stops at the measurement deadline; the command may finish afterward, bounded by `--fault-timeout`. An unfinished command and its descendants are killed and reaped before the harness returns.

## JSON Output

The program prints one JSON report to stdout and diagnostic/setup errors to stderr. Tokens are never included. `measurement.totals` and each fault window provide:

- attempts, successes, error count and bounded error classes;
- successful committed transactions and committed transactions per configured second;
- an exponential microsecond latency histogram with p50, p95, and p99 estimates;
- configured and observed wall duration.

The command exits nonzero for invalid configuration, setup failures, failed fault commands, or fault commands that exceed `--fault-timeout`. The JSON report is printed before a fault failure is returned. Request failures, including expected failures during a fault scenario, are captured in the report so an interrupted-service run remains analyzable.

## Monthly Cost Calculator

`queqlite-cost` emits an itemized monthly USD estimate from retained GB-month,
object-call counts, and explicit egress input/rate. Its checked-in defaults are
[`rates-2026-07-12.json`](rates-2026-07-12.json), dated **2026-07-12**:

- AWS S3 Standard, `us-east-1`: `$0.023/GiB-month`, `$0.005/1k` PUT/LIST, `$0.0004/1k` GET.
- GCS Standard, `us-central1`: `$0.020/GiB-month`, with the GB-month input converted to GiB-month.
- Azure Blob Hot LRS, `eastus2`: `$0.0184/GiB-month`, with the same PUT/LIST/GET rates.
- DELETE is free in all defaults. RustFS local has zero call fees and requires its storage rate argument.

Egress defaults to zero and must be supplied as both a quantity and, when it is
not zero-cost, `--egress-usd-per-gb`.

```sh
cargo run --release --manifest-path bench/Cargo.toml --bin queqlite-cost -- \
  --provider aws-s3-standard-us-east-1 --retained-gb-month 100 \
  --put-count 2000 --list-count 1000 --get-count 1000 --delete-count 1000 \
  --egress-gb 10 --egress-usd-per-gb 0.09

cargo run --release --manifest-path bench/Cargo.toml --bin queqlite-cost -- \
  --provider rustfs-local --retained-gb-month 100 \
  --rustfs-storage-usd-per-gb-month 0.01
```

## vind Runner

`scripts/bench-vind.sh` creates a disposable vind cluster, deploys the existing
RustFS and three-node Queqlite manifests through their existing render helpers,
then writes an `artifacts.json` manifest. It cleans up by default.

```sh
scripts/bench-vind.sh --duration 60s --warmup 10s --concurrency 4 \
  --fault pod-delete --fault-offset 20s
```

The runner defaults to synchronous durability. Bounded and periodic runs must
provide their mode-specific positive duration; unrelated parameters are rejected:

```sh
QUEQLITE_DURABILITY_MODE=bounded QUEQLITE_DURABILITY_MAX_LAG=250ms \
  scripts/bench-vind.sh --duration 60s --workload write

QUEQLITE_DURABILITY_MODE=periodic QUEQLITE_DURABILITY_INTERVAL=2s \
  scripts/bench-vind.sh --duration 60s --workload write
```

Durability durations accept positive integer values with `ms`, `s`, `m`, or `h`
suffixes. `artifacts.json` records the selected mode and the applicable
`max_lag` or `interval` under `configuration.durability`; the rendered cluster
manifest records the same environment configuration.

The runner always establishes and monitors all three local node forwards for
readiness and final checkpoint consensus. The default workload still targets
only the preferred first endpoint; `QUEQLITE_BENCH_MULTI_ENDPOINT=1` passes all
three forwards to the load generator for preferred-first failover. A dead or
invalid admin endpoint makes the evidence fail instead of reducing the quorum
being checked. Final checkpoint roots must agree on both index and the serialized
32-byte hash across all three nodes.

`artifacts.json.provenance` binds the run to the Git commit and dirty state plus
the Docker image content ID and available repository digests. A dirty source
tree or missing immutable image ID leaves an ordinary local run usable but sets
`publishable: false` with a reason. Publication also requires a successful
benchmark and runner exit, no failed evidence collection, and verified cleanup;
`--keep` runs are therefore not publishable. Only artifacts marked
`publishable: true` support release or published performance evidence. A
skip-build run additionally requires the image's
`org.opencontainers.image.revision` label to match the exact Git commit.
The same provenance records the benchmark client SHA-256, Rust toolchain
versions, and normalized Kubernetes runtime image digests. Queqlite and RustFS
are always required; disabled object metering marks its nginx and AWS inventory
images `not_applicable` instead of requiring them. All three Queqlite pods must
run the same digest as the locally inspected image.

It applies fixed default resources to make comparisons controlled on the
8-core/24-GiB host: each Queqlite and RustFS container requests `250m` CPU and
`512Mi` memory, with `1000m` and `1Gi` limits. RustFS is only the local S3
simulator and its resources are reported separately from Queqlite. Override them through
`QUEQLITE_BENCH_{QUEQLITE,RUSTFS}_CPU_{REQUEST,LIMIT}` and
`QUEQLITE_BENCH_{QUEQLITE,RUSTFS}_MEMORY_{REQUEST,LIMIT}`. Resource JSONL
samples use containerd CRI stats and their runtime-provided metric timestamp,
rather than the time the potentially slow collection started. CPU and memory
values must share that timestamp. Every stats response also receives a unique
collection batch ID, so app memory is summed across containers from the same
response even when their CRI timestamps are staggered. Missing, invalid, or
reused batch IDs invalidate the resource evidence. Each batch requires all three
Queqlite ordinals plus RustFS and, when enabled, its object-meter sidecar. Only
the named pod-delete target may be absent, only while the batch timestamps are
inside the verified fault window; that incomplete Queqlite batch is excluded
from memory averages and peaks instead of being counted as a partial snapshot.
`resource-summary.json`
reports container-lifecycle CPU deltas plus average/peak memory using samples
inside, or immediately bracketing, the Rust-reported measurement window. A
complete app collection's earliest and latest CRI timestamps classify that
memory batch; missing complete predecessor or successor batches invalidate the
summary. CPU windowing continues to use each container's runtime timestamp. A
pre-existing container uses its last pre-window counter as the baseline; a
container born in the window uses zero, and a same-identity counter regression
invalidates the evidence. Pod UID, container ID, and restart count must remain
stable for every component. A pod-delete run requires exactly one identity
transition for the named fault pod inside the verified fault window; any other
restart or identity transition invalidates the evidence. Warmup and later
cleanup samples are excluded.
Publishable evidence permits one missed collection plus one second of scheduling
jitter. The three-second collection timeout sends TERM and forces a kill one
second later, so the default continuity and final-coverage budget is twice the
two-second interval plus twice the four-second hard collection bound plus one
second (13 seconds). Final coverage may additionally finish the last hard-bounded
collection, for a 17-second wait budget. A pod-delete gap is accepted only for
the named Queqlite ordinal and only when it brackets the measured fault window
within the continuity budget; other missing component samples invalidate
publication. Disable resource sampling with
`QUEQLITE_BENCH_RESOURCE_SAMPLING=0`. A default-on nginx sidecar meters S3 method,
status, and byte counts, while an AWS CLI inventory records logical object count
and retained bytes in `object-usage.json`. Disable it with
`QUEQLITE_BENCH_OBJECT_USAGE_METERING=0`. The runner asserts that the deployment
uses zero PVCs. Its only fault hook deletes a Queqlite pod and waits for the
replacement to become Ready; it does not inject RustFS failures.
